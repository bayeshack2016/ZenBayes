1.B	Interests	Preferences for work environments and outcomes
1.B.1	Occupational Interests	Preferences for work environments. Occupational Interest Profiles (OIPs) are compatible with Holland's (1985, 1997) model of personality types and work environments. Six interest categories are used to describe the work environment of occupations: Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, and Conventional. An OIP consists of six numerical scores indicating how descriptive and characteristic each work environment (or interest area) is for an O*NET-SOC occupation. In addition, a high-point profile has been assigned indicating which interests are most characteristic of an O*NET-SOC occupation. A high-point profile consists of one to three interest codes, depending on how many interest categories meet a minimum degree of descriptiveness for the O*NET-SOC occupation.
1.B.1.a	Realistic	Realistic occupations frequently involve work activities that include practical, hands-on problems and solutions. They often deal with plants, animals, and real-world materials like wood, tools, and machinery. Many of the occupations require working outside, and do not involve a lot of paperwork or working closely with others.
1.B.1.b	Investigative	Investigative occupations frequently involve working with ideas, and require an extensive amount of thinking. These occupations can involve searching for facts and figuring out problems mentally.
1.B.1.c	Artistic	Artistic occupations frequently involve working with forms, designs and patterns. They often require self-expression and the work can be done without following a clear set of rules.
1.B.1.d	Social	Social occupations frequently involve working with, communicating with, and teaching people. These occupations often involve helping or providing service to others.
1.B.1.e	Enterprising	Enterprising occupations frequently involve starting up and carrying out projects. These occupations can involve leading people and making many decisions. Sometimes they require risk taking and often deal with business.
1.B.1.f	Conventional	Conventional occupations frequently involve following set procedures and routines. These occupations can include working with data and details more than with ideas. Usually there is a clear line of authority to follow.
1.B.1.g	First Interest High-Point	Primary-Rank Descriptiveness
1.B.1.h	Second Interest High-Point	Secondary-Cutoff/Rank Descriptiveness
1.B.1.i	Third Interest High-Point	Tertiary-Cutoff/Rank Descriptiveness
1.B.2	Work Values	Occupational Reinforcer Patterns (ORPs) indicate which work values and needs are likely to be reinforced or satisfied by a particular O*NET-SOC occupation. The use of work values to describe occupations is based on the Theory of Work Adjustment (TWA) developed during the Work Adjustment Project at the University of Minnesota under Research Grants from the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare (Dawis, R.V., England, G.W., & Lofquist, L.H., 1964; Dawis, R.V., & Lofquist, L.H., 1984). This theory proposes that job satisfaction is directly related to the degree to which a person's values and corresponding needs are satisfied by his or her work environment. The TWA identifies six work values each with a corresponding set of needs.
